# Emulates pinentry programs, with a static PIN
# This can be used to bypass PIN requirement while using GnuPG/scdaemon
# and automation. Another solution is to use PSCS/OpenSC.

# Obviously, this is a hack, even if it's pretty damn clean.
# This means, do not use this if you do not know what you are doing.

# If you don't know what to put here,
# you probably shouldn't be using this.
# 123456 is the default for OpenPGP smartcards
