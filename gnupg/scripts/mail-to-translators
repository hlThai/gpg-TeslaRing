Hi!

We are preparing for a new 2.0 release of GnuPG and like you to ask to
update your translation.  Unfortunately there is not much time left;
we can only include updates we receive by XXXXXXXXXXXXXX UTC.

Please find attached the very latest version of the PO file for your
GnuPG translation ($file).

It is important to have a basic understanding of GnuPG's functionality
to do a correct translation.  A false translation might lead to
security problems.  Please do *not to use the TP Robot* for GnuPG.

A release candidate for 2.0.xx is available at:

  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gnupg/
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gnupg/

Output of msgfmt is:
$(msgfmt --check --statistics $file 2>&1 | head)

If you are not able to continue the translation work, I suggest to
pass this message on to another translator and drop a short note to
gnupg-hackers@gnupg.org .


Happy hacking,

  Werner
